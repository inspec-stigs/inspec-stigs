  desc 'A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user\'s session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.  The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.'

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command: 

# touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

Add the setting to enable screensaver/session locking after 15 minutes of inactivity:

[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]

idle-delay=uint32 900

After the setting has been set, run dconf update.'

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

Check to see if GNOME is configured to display a screensaver after a 15 minute delay with the following command:

# grep -i idle-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
idle-delay=uint32 900

If the "idle-delay" setting is missing or is not set to “900” or less, this is a finding.'
