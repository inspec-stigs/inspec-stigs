  desc 'A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify when a user\'s session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.  The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled.'

Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

Add the setting to enable session locking when a screensaver is activated:

After the setting has been set, run dconf update.'

Note: If the system does not have GNOME installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

If GNOME is installed, check to see a session lock occurs when the screensaver is activated with the following command:

# grep -i lock-delay /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*
lock-delay=uint32 5

If the “lock-delay” setting is missing, or is not set, this is a finding.'
