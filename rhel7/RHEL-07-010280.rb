  desc 'Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because attackers may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected access to the system. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.  Operating systems need to track periods of inactivity and disable application identifiers after zero days of inactivity.'
